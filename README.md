# Knowledge Base

This is my attempt to start making a notes of things as I learn them, rather than just assuming I will remember them.

I doubt anyone will ever see this, but if you do, and you spot something I have got glaringly wrong (other than my spelling!) then please let me know.

Thanks
Simon
